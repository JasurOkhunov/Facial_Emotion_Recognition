# Facial Emotion Recognition

This repo contains a study of the facial emotion recognition problem in computer vision. 
The dataset used for development is the FER 2013 dataset available on Kaggle: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013

The network developed is a convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the VGG16 architecture. It achieves near human level of accuracy on the test data without reliance on any external datasets or pre-training.

For more details on the network architecture and the obtained results, please look at Report.pdf
The codebase for the project can be found under the code folder in this repo
